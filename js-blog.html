    <h1>What is JavaScript?</h1>
    <p>JavaScript is a programming language that powers the web! Hey, but don't forget Study Buds is also powered by JavaScript or Lumo will be super sad! </p>
    <h2>Why JavaScript?</h2>
    <p>Well, you better choose JavaScript if you are into web! Imagine a robot! Robot Lumo! Robot Lumo maybe have really beautiful colors and a face, but for robots we use C++ or Python, but we use JavaScript for websites! Imagine JavaScript is like the wires and batteries for out website!</p>
